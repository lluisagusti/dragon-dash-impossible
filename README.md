# 🐉 DRAGON DASH IMPOSSIBLE 🐉

**"The most impossible-est dragon game ever created!"**

Welcome to **Dragon Dash Impossible**! This is my very first game, and guess what? I'm pretty proud of it. It's simple, it's a bit of a test, and yes, it might be impossible to beat, but that's part of the charm, right?

## 🚀 Play it NOW!
Don't just look at the code, play the magic here:
👉 **[Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://lluisagusti.github.io/dragon-dash-impossible/)**

## 🎮 How to Play
It's easier than riding a real dragon:
- **TAP (Mobile)** or **CLICK/SPACE (Web)** to jump.
- **HOLD** to glide through the air like a majestic lizard.
- **COLLECT RINGS** because shiny things are great.
- **DOUBLE JUMP** in mid-air to defy physics!

## 🛠️ The Dragon's Bones (Tech Stack)
I built this using some seriously cool stuff:
- **React Native & Expo**: The power behind the dragon's wings.
- **Expo Router**: So the dragon knows where it's going.
- **Lucide Icons**: For those sweet, sweet UI touches.
- **Perl magic**: To make sure it deploys perfectly everywhere.

## 💻 Run it Locally
Want to see the dragon on your own machine?
1. **Clone it**: `git clone https://github.com/lluisagusti/dragon-dash-impossible.git`
2. **Install things**: `npm install`
3. **Ignition**: `npx expo start`
